**TL;DR**

sphinx-no-pragma is a Sphinx extension for stripping pragma comments
from source code used in documentation.

If that's all you need to know to move forward, jump right to the
installation. Otherwise, read further.

======================================================================

Some say, "documentation is the king". Others argue - "no, demos are".
While some say, "testing is everything!" and yet there will be someone
else who will jump in with "write clean code! black, isort, mypy and
ruff everywhere!"

And yet there's you, who want to be good and write a better package,
because there's a generic problem that needs to be solved, and you
know how, you want to share it with the world. You also want to assure
or at least make an effort in making your project developer friendly,
attractive for making contributions, which eventually leads to
continuous improvement and make it live long(er).

So, combining the best practices, you:

* Introduce examples in your repository to make it easier to start
  with.

* Write awesome docs with usage examples (by eventually repeating
  yourself, copying things from your actual code examples).

* Write tests for your code. Then you realize it's good to test the
  examples too. Eventually, you have now almost the same code in 3
  places: tests, examples and docs.

* Introduce linters and MyPy.

Then you invest your time in making sure all your code looks correct
and fix the never-ending MyPy issues.

Then you need to make a small change, which unfortunately, among
other, requires altering the examples code. You need to change the
examples, the docs, the tests and the examples tests. However, you
also need to push the change quickly. As many times before, you skip
documentation update, leaving it for "another time".

By that time you discover that code maintenance is a hell. You fix
everything, tests pass you're happy to push, by then MyPy starts to
nag about issues you have no idea how to solve and by that moment you
don't care about them. You're sick of it and start using pragma
comments to silence the errors, leaving the fix for another day. Your
maintenance work involves a lot of copy-pasting from one place to
another (examples, tests, documentation).

Does this sound familiar?

======================================================================

What if I tell you that actually a couple of steps can be taken out.
Namely, that you can use your example code directly in your
documentation, using ".. literalinclude::" directive of Sphinx. That
part has already been well covered in jsphinx project (JavaScript
primarily). However, what jsphinx didn't solve is presence of pragma
comments in your documentation. This project does take care of that
part. You don't need to choose or balance between readability,
explainability and low-maintenance.

experience in writing low-maintenance code.


Features
========

* Accurately stips out pragma comments from your source code that you
  include in your documentation.


Prerequisites
=============

Python 3.10+


Installation
============

   pip install sphinx-no-pragma


Documentation
=============

* Documentation is available on Read the Docs.

* For guidelines on contributing check the Contributor guidelines.


Usage example
=============

In order to move forward, you first need to get educate yourself a
little on Sphinx's directives. Namely the ".. literalinclude::" and
":download:". For that, first read the jsphinx documentation.

But there might be a little problem with that. Of course you might be
lucky and have zero pragma comments in your code (no "# noqa", no "#
type: ignore", etc). But more often, you get at least a couple of
these. Your perfectionist nature doesn't easily allow you to let them
be part of your concise, beautiful documentation. Cursing me for
earlier advices, you start to replace your DRY documentation part with
copy-pasted examples.

This is where this package jumps in. It simply is a Sphinx extension
that strips all pragma comments from your code that goes into
documentation.


Sphinx configuration
--------------------


Essential configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Filename: docs/conf.py*

   extensions = [
       # ... other extensions
       "sphinx_no_pragma",
       # ... other extensions
   ]


Fine-tuning what to strip
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the following markers are stripped:

* "# type: ignore"

* "# noqa"

* "# pragma: no cover"

* "# pragma: no branch"

* "# fmt: off"

* "# fmt: on"

* "# fmt: skip"

* "# yapf: disable"

* "# yapf: enable"

* "# pylint: disable"

* "# pylint: enable"

* "# flake8: noqa"

* "# noinspection"

* "# pragma: allowlist secret"

* "# pragma: NOSONAR"

If you want to alter the default behaviour, define a
"ignore_comments_endings" variable in your Sphinx configuration file
("docs/conf.py") as shown below:

*Filename: docs/conf.py*

   ignore_comments_endings = [
       "# type: ignore",
       "# noqa",
       "# pragma: no cover",
       "# pragma: no branch",
       "# fmt: off",
       "# fmt: skip",
       "# yapf: disable",
       "# pylint: disable",
       "# flake8: noqa",
       "# noinspection",
   ]

If you want to simply extend the list of markers, use another variable
to define your own list, that would be appended to the default one.

*Filename: docs/conf.py*

   # Set user defined endings
   user_ignore_comments_endings = [
       "# [start]",
   ]


Code example
------------

*Filename: examples/example_1.py*

   from typing import Any, Optional

   class ThirdPartyLibrary:
       @staticmethod
       def get_dynamic_object() -> Any:
           # Returns an object whose type is not known at compile time
           return "a string"  # In reality, this could be any type


   # Usage of the third-party library
   obj = ThirdPartyLibrary.get_dynamic_object()

   # Attempt to use the object as a string, even though its type is 'Any'
   length = len(obj)  # type: ignore

   # Deliberately long line to violate PEP 8 line length rule, suppressed with noqa
   print(f"The length of the object, a dynamically typed one, is just {length}")  # noqa

Given that this is your code structure:

   ├── examples
   │  └── example_1.py
   ├── docs
   │  ├── conf.py
   │  ├── index.rst
   │  ├── Makefile
   │  ├── _static
   │  │  └── example_1.py
   │  └── usage.rst
   ├── LICENSE
   ├── Makefile
   ├── pyproject.toml
   ├── README.rst
   └── sphinx_no_pragma.py

Either use "html_extra_path = ["examples"]" or make a symlink to
"examples/example_1.py" from "docs/_static".

Then include it in your docs as follows:

*Filename: example.rst*

   .. container:: jsphinx-download

   .. literalinclude:: _static/example_1.py
       :name: test_example_1
       :language: python
       :lines: 1-

   *See the full example*
   :download:`here <_static/example_1.py>`

Now, rendered, your code will not contain *# type: ignore* or *# noqa*
pragma comments.
